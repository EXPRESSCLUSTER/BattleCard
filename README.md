# EXPRESSCLUSTER Battle Card

## Elevator pitch

**EXPRESSCLUSTER is a software that provides high availability and disaster recovery to prevent system downtime and data loss, ultimately saving time and money.**

Automate the detection and recovery of failures in critical IT systems.

- Monitoring and recovering from all types of failures (storage, network, OS, Application etc.)
- Achieving zero data loss on any failures and disasters
- Enabling low cost software solution without shared SAN storage
- Operation track record with 200+ applications
- Disaster recovery track record of 1000+ km

## Qualifying questions

- Do you have a system that needs to be up and running 24/7?
- When you happen to restore a backup in the event of a failure or disaster, you will lose the data accumulated since the last backup. Is there any data that cannot afford such a loss?
- You might have redundancy and monitoring for hardware components like storage (RAID) and network (NIC teaming). However, do you have it for software components such as the OS and applications?
