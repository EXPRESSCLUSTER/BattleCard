## Qualifying questions

- Do you need a system to run 24/7?
- Do you have data that must not be lost, no matter what the situation?
  - Just protecting data with backup results in data loss due to changes made after the previous backup.
- Do you have the redundancy and monitoring for software components such as the OS and applications?
  - You may have redundancy and monitoring for hardware components like storage (RAID) and network (NIC teaming).
